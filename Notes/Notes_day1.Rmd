# Key Concepts and Principles

## Sample Size Considerations
- **General Recommendation**: Sample size should be more than the number of features, ideally 10x larger
- **Data-Model Trade-off**: The less data you have, the more modeling effort you need to invest
- **Context-Dependent**: Sample size adequacy varies by application
  - Some cases: 100 samples may be sufficient
  - Other cases: Millions of samples may still be inadequate

## Mathematical Framework

### Linear Model Representation
$$Y = \alpha + \beta X$$

**Where:**
- **Y** = Phenotype variable (outcome/response variable)
- **X** = Omics data (e.g., gene expression, protein levels, metabolite concentrations)
- **α** (alpha) = Intercept term
- **β** (beta) = Slope coefficient/effect size

### Variable Definitions
- **Phenotype variable (Y)**: The biological trait or clinical outcome being studied
- **Omics data (X)**: High-dimensional molecular measurements
  - Examples: Gene expression profiles, protein abundance, metabolomics data

# Important Notes
- Quality and relevance of data often matter more than sheer quantity
- Model complexity should be balanced with available sample size
- Feature selection becomes crucial when dealing with high-dimensional omics data

# Statistical Approaches

## Frequentist Statistics
**Core Principle**: Based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

### Key Characteristics:
- **Summary Statistics Focus**: Emphasizes point estimates and confidence intervals
- **P-value Emphasis**: Heavy reliance on p-values for hypothesis testing
- **Limitations in Omics**:
  - Over-focus on p-values can be problematic with high-dimensional data
  - Multiple testing corrections become critical
  - May not capture uncertainty effectively in complex models

### Frequentist vs. Other Approaches:
- **Advantages**: Well-established, computationally efficient for simple models
- **Challenges**: Less flexibility for incorporating prior knowledge
- **In Omics Context**: Can struggle with high-dimensional, low-sample-size scenarios
